An Easy Game where you need to get your triangle the same color as the background.
Be careful! Your triangle and background have the speed of color  changing!

Keys: WASD or Arrow keys

What? HOW?

Try to understand the logic.
You have 5 types of speed.

speed - triangle speed
colorspeed1 - speed of chaging color #1
colorspeed2 - speed of chaging color #2
colorspeed3 - speed of chaging color #3
colorspeed4 - speed of chaging color #4

You have 6 colors  (+2 which are alpha, but the alpha is set to 100 for all the colors)

Red  Gre  Blu  Alp
Red2 Gre2 Blu2 Alp2

I will say nothing but look on this order:

UP   > LEFT   > RIGHT   > DOWN
Red  > Gre    > Blu     > Alp
Red2 > Gre2   > Blu2    > Alp2

Main color (RGB) += colorspeed1
Other colors (RGB) -= colorspeed2

Main color (RGB2) += colorspeed3
Other colors (RGB2) -= colorspeed4


You understand the difficulty to finish this game now??))
You don't need to click on  whatever you did. If you will finish, you will see it directly on your screen.
GOOD LUCK!
